# K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier

A robust and intuitive implementation of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm for classification and regression tasks. This implementation focuses on efficiency and ease of use, featuring optimized distance calculations and spatial indexing for faster neighbor searches.

## Features

- 🚀 Optimized K-nearest neighbor search using KD-trees
- 📏 Multiple distance metrics (Euclidean, Manhattan, Minkowski, etc.)
- ⚖️ Support for both classification and regression
- 🎯 Automated k-value selection through cross-validation
- 🔄 Weighted voting based on distance
- 📊 Built-in data normalization and preprocessing
- 🎨 Visualization tools for decision boundaries
- 💾 Model serialization support

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/knn-classifier.git
cd knn-classifier
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Quick Start

```python
from knn import KNNClassifier

# Initialize the classifier
knn = KNNClassifier(n_neighbors=5, metric='euclidean')

# Train the model
knn.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
predictions = knn.predict(X_test)

# Get probability estimates
probabilities = knn.predict_proba(X_test)
```

## Performance Optimizations

- **KD-Tree Implementation**: O(log n) complexity for neighbor searches
- **Ball-Tree Support**: Efficient handling of high-dimensional data
- **Batch Processing**: Vectorized operations for faster prediction
- **Parallel Processing**: Multi-threading support for large datasets

## Advanced Features

### Distance Metrics
- Euclidean Distance
- Manhattan Distance
- Minkowski Distance
- Cosine Similarity
- Hamming Distance
- Custom metric support

### Weighting Options
- Uniform weights
- Distance-based weights
- Custom weighting functions

## Use Cases

- **Pattern Recognition**: Image and signal classification
- **Recommendation Systems**: Product and content recommendations
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identifying outliers in datasets
- **Medical Diagnosis**: Patient condition classification
- **Financial Analysis**: Credit risk assessment

## Visualization Tools

```python
# Plot decision boundaries
knn.plot_decision_boundary(X, y)

# Visualize neighbor distances
knn.plot_neighbor_distances(X_test[0])
```
